Description: Implements methods for variable selection in generalized linear 
  models (GLMs), especially logistic and Poisson regression. The current 
  method, named "Generalized Sum of Single Effects" (GSuSiE) model, 
  is developed from the "Sum of Single Effects" (SuSiE) model proposed 
  by Wang et al (2020) <DOI:10.1101/501114>. This method is compatible for 
  sparse variable selection problem in high-dimensional settings, especially 
  when variables are highly correlated. This method provides summaries such as 
  posterior inclusion probabilities (PIPs) and credible sets to make inferences 
  on which variables should be selected. Additionally, robust estimations are 
  provided to avoid the potential affect of outliers to model fitting. The 
  adapted iterative Bayesian Stepwise Selection (IBSS) algorithm is combined 
  with iterative reweighted least squared (IRLS) to address GLMs and robust 
  estimation.
