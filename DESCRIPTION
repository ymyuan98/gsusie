Description: This package implements methods for variable selection in 
  generalized linear models (GLMs), especially logistic and Poisson regression. 
  The current method, named "Generalized Sum of Single Effects" (GSuSiE), 
  is developed from the "Sum of Single Effects" (SuSiE) model proposed 
  by Wang et al. (2020) <DOI:10.1101/501114>. This method is compatible with 
  sparse variable selection problems in high-dimensional settings, especially 
  when variables are highly correlated. This method provides summaries such as 
  posterior inclusion probabilities (PIPs) and credible sets to make inferences 
  on which variables should be selected. Additionally, robust estimations are 
  provided to avoid the potential effect of outliers on model fitting. 
  The adapted iterative Bayesian Stepwise Selection (IBSS) algorithm is combined 
  with the iterative reweighted least squared (IRLS) approach to address GLMs 
  and robust estimation.
