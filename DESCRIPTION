Description: Implements methods for variable selection in generalized linear 
model, especially logistic and Poisson regression, based on xxx. The current 
method is developed from the "Sum of Single Effects" (SuSiE) model proposed 
by Wang et al (2020) doi 10.1101/501114. This method is compatible for 
sparse variable selection problem in high-dimensional settings, especially when 
variables are highly correlated. This method provides summaries such as 
posterior inclusion probabilities (PIPs) and credible sets to make inferences on 
which variables should be selected. Additionally, robust estimations are 
provided to avoid the potential affect of outliers to model fitting. The adapted
iterative Bayesian Stepwise Selection (IBSS) algorithm is combined with 
iterative reweighted least squared (IRLS) to address GLMs and robust estimation.
