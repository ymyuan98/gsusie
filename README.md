# gsusie-package

This repo is an R package of the Generalized Sum of Single-Effects (GSuSiE) model. 
Developed from the Sum of Single-Effects (SuSiE) model [Wang et al. (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1111/rssb.12388) 
that performs variable selection on linear regressions, 
the GSuSiE model expands the usage by allowing to selection of variables from generalized linear models (GLMs) such as 
logistic and Poisson regressions. 

The package is still under development.
